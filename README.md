Jigsaw
======

- Take a picture of all un-placed jigsaw pieces arranged such that none overlap.
- Take a picture of the pieces to the top, left, right, and bottom of a missing piece (if not all the edges are available, take a picture of as many as you can).
- The server shows which jigsaw pieces are most likely to fit in the missing piece location.
